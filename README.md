Page 1: A Visual Marvel - The Home Page
Navigation Bar: The Home Page welcomes visitors with an elegant navigation bar adorned with three intriguing options: 'Home,' 'Grid,' and 'LinkedIn.' These options offer a smooth and intuitive browsing experience.

Section 1 - HTML Elegance: The heart of the page boasts a captivating HTML element, carefully designed to exude sophistication and creativity. Its curved vertices add a touch of artistry to the digital canvas.

Section 2 - The E-cell Logo: In the second section, the E-cell logo takes center stage, filling the container with a bold and striking presence. This design choice symbolizes the importance of innovation and entrepreneurship.

Section 3 - The Interactive Grid: The third section houses a 3x3 grid, home to nine mesmerizing blue squares. What makes this grid truly special is its interactive nature. When you click on a square, it magically transforms into a vibrant shade of red. For the tech-savvy, there's even an advanced feature - clicking on the bottom-right square triggers a sequence that turns all squares blue again.

Page 2: The Canvas of Self - My Personal Profile
Personal Showcase: On the second page, I wanted to introduce myself in a more personal and creative way. It features my photograph, name, and registration number, presented with a touch of elegance.

Instagram Connection: To connect with visitors on a more personal level, I added a button that leads them straight to my Instagram handle. This feature not only enhances user engagement but also showcases my proficiency in web development.

Conclusion: A Fusion of Art and Technology
This web development project allowed me to blend my creative instincts with technical prowess. The result is a harmonious symphony of design and functionality that not only serves its purpose but also engages and delights users. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of web development as a canvas for self-expression and innovation.
